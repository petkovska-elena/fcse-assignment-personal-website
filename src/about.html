                        They told me life rewards the patient ones. So naturally, I did the opposite.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        I started young, chasing medals instead of weekends. Math competitions, logic puzzles, international olympiads, I was the teenager calculating probabilities while others calculated how to sneak out after curfew. I brought home a bronze cup from a global math competition, only to be told later that I wasn’t quite what the world’s top universities were looking for. Apparently, perseverance and sleeplessness aren’t valid criteria on Ivy League applications.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        So I built my own plan. With caffeine instead of scholarships. With sticky notes instead of mentors. And with an attitude that screamed, “Fine, I’ll do it myself.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        At 19, I moved out. Paid rent. Filed taxes. You know how fun is that? Learned that your biggest life lessons often come with broken appliances and zero savings. I became my own mother, manager, IT support, therapist, and alarm clock, all before breakfast.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        I didn’t wait to feel “ready.” I took projects I had no business taking. Said yes, then figured it out, one YouTube tutorial and sleep-deprived breakdown at a time. And somehow, in the middle of all that chaos, I built many things.                    
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-description">
                        No perfect timing here. Just impulsive decisions, questionable optimism, and a deep-rooted belief that burnout builds character.
                        I’m not “multi-disciplinary.” I’m just too stubborn to quit.
